            I spent three months during the summer of 2015 working full time as a developer co-op at Heartland Payment Systems.
            I addressed hundreds of service desk tickets which involved writing insert, update, and delete queries to manage customers accounts worth thousands of dollars.
            I wrote programs to automate common tasks and reduce the number of tickets that had to be handled manually.
            I also developed a set of web pages that allows users to update certain database tables without having to create a ticket. The pages use ASP.NET MVC, C#, JavaScript, and SQL.

        <p class="justify-text">
            I have worked part-time at Walgreens for almost three years while being a full-time university student.
            I developed film, print photos, and make custom canvases, wooden block prints, calendars, and magnets.
            I give my coworkers breaks and have experience in all front end departments. I check out customers at the front register, help customers choose fragrances in cosmetics, and work on the floor helping customers find products, unloading truck, stocking shelves, constructing displays, and resetting shelves among other tasks.
            I also keep the store clean by sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, taking out the trash, replacing toiletries, and cleaning various surfaces throughout the store such as counters, windows, and mirrors.
